I've been enjoying doing art mostly in the form of pencil drawings since when I was very young, but I always struggled finding time to do it properly. Only recently (as soon as PhD was over;)) I discovered my passion for trying out different kinds of paintings.

Sunflower is one of my favourite subjects to paint up to date.

I like these white roses so much I painted them twice on different surfaces (wood and canvas). There may be some form of 'superresolution'.

I learn to paint landscapes from Bob Ross and various YouTube artists e.g. [Acrylic Painting Techniques](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUEpzDKG9NCkfU6RL88E3aw).

The biggest painting I've done so far is this one of Glencoe from the highland.

On a beautiful sunny day towards the end of my PhD, I went to do some sketching with friends on Bristol Square, Edinburgh, and this is the outcome:
