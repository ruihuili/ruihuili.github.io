I am a machine learning Research Scientist at Samsung AI Centre in Cambridge, UK. My research is currently focused on generalisation and transferability of machine learning models on resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices. I explore different machine learning paradigms including meta-learning, few-shot learning, and more recently federated learning. In the past, I have worked on acoustic signal processing and resource allocation in wireless mobile communications. 

Prior to Samsung AI, I obtained my PhD from the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh in 2019. I was advised by [Prof Paul Patras](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ppatras/), and I remain a good friend of the [Mobile Intelligence Lab](https://mi.inf.ed.ac.uk/).
