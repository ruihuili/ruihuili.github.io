I am a Research Scientist at Samsung AI Centre in Cambridge, UK. My research is currently focused on efficient inference and training of large language models and stable diffusion models in resource constrained environment. In the past years, I have worked on a number of different machine learning paradigms including meta-learning, few-shot learning, and federated learning, and applications of these in different domains such as vision recognition and wireless mobile communications. 

Prior to Samsung AI, I obtained my PhD from the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh in 2019. I was advised by [Prof Paul Patras](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ppatras/), and I remain a good friend of the [Mobile Intelligence Lab](https://mi.inf.ed.ac.uk/).
