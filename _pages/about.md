I am a Research Scientist in Artificial Intelligence working within the DistributedAI group and GenAI team at Samsung AI Centre in Cambridge, UK. My research is currently focused on efficient inference and fine-tuning of large language models and stable diffusion models in resource constrained environment. In the past years, I have worked on a number of different machine learning paradigms including meta-learning, few-shot learning, and federated learning, and applications of these in different domains such as vision recognition and wireless mobile communications. 

Prior to Samsung AI, I obtained my PhD from the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh in 2019. I was advised by [Prof Paul Patras](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ppatras/), and I remain a good friend of the [Mobile Intelligence Lab](https://mi.inf.ed.ac.uk/).
